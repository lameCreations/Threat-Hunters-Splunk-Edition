    n sensai "The early tag line for the pfSense open source project was “making sense of pf”, referring to the packet filter technology at the core of the project."
    n sensai "PF in FreeBSD can perform many of the basic packet filtering and QoS firewall tasks that pfSense software provides, however, pfSense software makes it easier to manage, monitor, and maintain. "
    n sensai "PFSense layers an easy to use GUI and customized services on top of the operating system and relevant packages, resulting in a complete firewall/router/VPN solution that is capable of much more than the sum of the underlying components."
    n sensai "Common Deployments"
    n sensai "pfSense software can meet the needs of nearly any type and size of network environment, from a SOHO to datacenter environments. "
    n sensai "Perimeter Firewall"
    n sensai "The most common deployment of pfSense software is a perimeter firewall. "
    n sensai "pfSense software accommodates networks requiring multiple Internet connections, multiple LAN networks, and multiple DMZ networks. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), connection redundancy, and load balancing capabilities are configurable as well."
    n sensai "LAN or WAN Router"
    n sensai "pfSense software configured as a LAN or WAN router and perimeter firewall is a common deployment in small networks. LAN and WAN routing are separate roles in larger networks."
    n sensai "LAN Router"
    n sensai "pfSense software is a proven solution for connecting multiple internal network segments. "
    n sensai "This is most commonly deployed with VLANs configured with 802.1Q trunking, described more in Virtual LANs (VLANs). "
    n sensai "Multiple Ethernet interfaces are also used in some environments. "
    n sensai "WAN Router"
    n sensai "pfSense software is a great solution for Internet Service Providers. It offers all the functionality required by most networks at a much lower price point than other commercial offerings."
    n sensai "Special Purpose Appliances"
    n sensai "pfSense software can be utilized for less common deployment scenarios as a stand-alone appliance. Examples include: VPN appliance, Sniffer appliance, and DHCP server appliance."
    n sensai "VPN Appliance"
    n sensai "pfSense software installed as a separate Virtual Private Network appliance adds VPN capabilities without disrupting the existing firewall infrastructure, and includes multiple VPN protocols."
    n sensai "Sniffer Appliance"
    n sensai "pfSense software offers a web interface for the tcpdump packet analyzer. The captured .cap files are downloaded and analyzed in Wireshark."
    n sensai "DHCP Server Appliance"
    n sensai "pfSense software can be deployed strictly as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server, however, there are limitations of the pfSense software GUI for advanced configuration of the ISC DHCP daemon."
    n sensai "PfSense provides a feature rich free alternative to providing many network capabilities to your network"
