    n sensai "Security Onion is a free and open platform built by defenders for defenders. It includes network visibility, host visibility, intrusion detection honeypots, log management, and case management."
    n sensai "For network visibility, we offer signature based detection via Suricata, rich protocol metadata and file extraction using your choice of either Zeek or Suricata, full packet capture via Stenographer, and file analysis via Strelka."
    n sensai "For host visibility, we offer the Elastic Agent which provides data collection, live queries via osquery, and centralized management using Elastic Fleet."
    n sensai "Intrusion detection honeypots based on OpenCanary can be added to your deployment for even more enterprise visibility."
    n sensai "All of these logs flow into the Elastic stack and we've built our own user interfaces for alerting, hunting, dashboards, case management, and grid management."
    n sensai "Security Onion and the tools and its integrated tools are all open to the public, written by members of the cyber security community. Source code is available in GitHub for review by those interested in understanding how the system works, behind the scenes."
